# MortivagusGame
Mortivagus is a 2D platformer game created in Godot as my first ever game project. It features classic platformer mechanics where the player can jump over enemies to defeat them. Set in a zombie apocalypse world, the game only offers a basic experience with only level and no clear win condition or progression.   Any feedback is welcomed!  :)
